#Title: Git usage recommendation for collaborations

Recommendations:
1. Use command - "git pull origin master" to update your local master branch before working.

2. Use command - "git checkout <<branch name>>" to switch branch you want to work on.

3. Always switch on your own branch after update you master branch. Never work on master branch directly!

4. After split the work, do NOT change any other people's work. Work on your own part.

5. Inform your teammates before "git push origin <<branch name>>".

6. Never push directly into master branch, push to your own branch instead.

7. Make your commit message helpful. See the commit standard text file. Stay with the format.

8. Every commit should achieve one goal. For example: add new feature.

9. Try to divide your work into several steps, each time you finish 1 step commit to your local repository.
